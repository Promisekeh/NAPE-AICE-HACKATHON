## Objectives

- **Industry Challenges:** Solve real-world problems faced by the industry.
- **Showcase Skills:** Provide a platform for participants to demonstrate their technical skills.
- **Innovation:** Encourage the development of new tools and technologies that can make an impact.

## Target Audience

This hackathon is open to:
- **Industry Professionals and Experts**
- **Software Developers with an Interest in Geoscience**
- **Data Scientists and Analysts**
- **Students and Researchers in Geoscience**

## Platform Requirements

Participants will work strictly with Python environments or other data science tools. **No conventional industry software is required**, allowing for a focus on Python-based solutions.


## Submission Guidelines

1. **Attend the Event**  
   - This hackathon is an in-person event. All participants will receive datasets on-site at the start of the competition.

2. **Data & Task**  
   - Participants will use the provided datasets to train a machine-learning model that addresses the specified challenge.
   - Your model will be evaluated based on its performance on a hidden test dataset, which the judges will use for final scoring.

3. **Model Submission**  
   - **Code:** Submit all relevant code files to train and deploy your model.
   - **Model Artifacts:** Export and include your final trained model as a `.pkl` or equivalent file format.
   - **Documentation:** Include a README file that outlines your approach, any preprocessing steps, the machine learning algorithm used, hyperparameters, and other notable information about your solution.

4. **Submission Format**  
   - Each team or individual will submit their solution by uploading a zip file containing:
     - All code files and model artifacts
     - Documentation (README file and any additional notes)
   - Files should be named and organized clearly to facilitate easy evaluation.

5. **Deadline**  
   - All submissions must be completed by the end of the event.

6. **Judging Criteria**  
   - Submissions will be judged based on:
     - Model accuracy on the hidden test dataset
     - Code quality and documentation
     - Creativity and innovation in approach.

> **Note:** Please include a README within your project folder detailing your approach, tools used, and any other relevant information.
